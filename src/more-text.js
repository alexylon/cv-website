            I'm a fullstack engineer by trade. Keeping up with programming languages, frameworks, and design patterns is the permanent education we sign up for, yet it's also the means by which we work our creative magic. I believe it is important not to become compartmentalized or to let a skill set stagnate.

            My tech love remains Rust programming language. In this context as a theologian I would exclaim along with the timeless Bible verse "but the greatest of these is love" also "but the greatest of these is Rust".

            And yet, most skills can be learned and improved, but the ability to solve problems and learn plus a mindset of interpersonal communication help me to contribute to nurturing a collaborative and roundtable environment where people feel empowered, valued and effective members of a team.
